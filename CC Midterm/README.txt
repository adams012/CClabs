For my project I wanted to creative a text adventure game where the user can choose one of two story lines and play, in hopes of keeping the mental, emotional, and physical levels of the two main characters healthy. I made this with javascript, html, and css. The images were taken from freepik, and I used the canvas from code.pen.
