Jackie decides she needs to take more time for herself anywhere she can find it. She does a half an hour of yoga and it decreased her levels of stress and increases her physical levels. After work she learns she has a work meeting and they want her to present her ideas. 

Her stress levels rise back to original levels. She’s bored the entire time, but at least at the end they have snacks. Ooh, what a beautiful assortment of snacks. Is that Dulce de Flecken? The Germany exclusive chocolate that Jackie dreams about? In full sized bars?  She looks around. She doesn’t see anyone. 

What should she do?
