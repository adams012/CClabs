Mary decides to treat herself to a day of shopping. The running from store to store and carrying heavy bags helps increase her physical levels, and the shopping therapy eases her stress. Now, she's ready for a nice...

OH NO.

Mary is about to exit the mall when she sees a few of her coworkers walking in the door.

She could try to talk her way out of it, but is her stress reduced enough?

What should Mary do? Quick! You put her in this mess! GET HER OUT!
