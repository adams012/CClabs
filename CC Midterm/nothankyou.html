Jackie says, “No thank you.”

He respectfully excuses himself and Jackie sits alone waiting for her check. She starts to feel a little sad that she missed the opportunity. He seemed really nice. Her emotional levels decrease. Still, that’s okay. Maybe she can plan something that will restore her emotional levels sometime this weekend instead? If she makes it that far…

She goes to sleep.

Next work day...

Jackie is at again work and trying to brainstorm ideas. She’s at her desk and her stress levels are really rising again. She needs to make a change. 

What should she do?
