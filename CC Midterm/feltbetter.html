Jackie says, "I started to feel better, so I went to buy some new work clothes. I don't want anyone to get sick from my old ones."

Her coworkers laugh. "That's a great excuse to buy more things, but we appreciate it haha."

She smiles and they talk about what she missed at work. She throws in a few coughs here and there which gets some sympathy and they tell her to hurry home so she can rest. 

"Don't over do it!"

"Of course!"

Jackie waves them away and leaves the mall.

Freaking <em>nailed</em> it.

What now?

She feels a thrill which increases her mental wellness and decreases her stress, but she is hungry.
